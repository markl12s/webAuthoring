<h1>The Truth about Elephants</h1>

A baby elephant hanging out with its mom, aunts
and great-aunts, and maybe even its grandmother



<p>
It's hard to tell what goes through a baby elephant's mind when its mom is trying
to put it to sleep. Do you think baby elephants wake up in the middle of the night
and cry? Do their moms and dads take turns getting up with them to rock them back
to sleep? How <em>do</em> you rock an elephant, anyway?
</p>

<p>
And what about gorillas? Today in the paper there's a story about a new gorilla
that was just born in Franklin Park. Its mom is holding on to it just like any
proud human mom. And I have to wonder if they go through as much trauma as that
human mom when it comes to sleep, and food, and diapers, and running into the
street.
</p>

<p>
Why is it so easy for them? Are they better parents? Do they just not worry about
every little detail? I've never known a gorilla to read and study carefully
seventeen books on bringing up baby gorillas. And they seem to know just what to
do. They never worry about spoiling their little gorilla babies. They never worry
about not having enough time with them. Now, on't get me wrong, I'd rather be human
than a gorilla any day. Just imagine having to sit in a zoo. Forget discrete
nursing... (Did you figure out yet that while gorillas were on my mind, I could
only find a picture of an elephant?)
