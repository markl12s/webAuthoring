          The Saint Paul Hospital at the top of Gaudí Avenue in the Sagrada Família
          neighborhood is an oft-overlooked gem of modernist architecture. Although
          the building was begun in 1902 under the direction of the architect Lluís
          Domènec i Montaner, the hospital itself dates from the 14th century. It
          serves some 34,000 inpatients yearly, along with more than 150,000
          emergency room...

            Outside it feels like a battle is raging, with firecrackers going off
            left and right in honor of Sant Joan, but in the cloister of Barcelona's
            12th century Cathedral, it's quiet enough to hear the trickle of the
            water from the fountain. As everywhere else in Barcelona, Saint George
            is slaying his dragon here. Somehow... </p>

          <p>Quiet returns. And the refrigerator was empty, so off I set on my way
          to the market. The plan was homemade sushi with friends so I made the
          trip down to the central Barcelona market: the <i>Boquería</i>. I never
          get tired of coming here. There are rows and rows of busy stalls with
          fresh fruit and vegetables, and spices and nuts, hams and upside-down
          chickens. And more than a couple of crazy tourists like me taking
          pictures. I confuse the locals by talking to them in Catalan, but...

      <p>
      Around the corner from our apartment there is a mosaics studio. Last year
      and the year before, I walked by and looked in wistfully, thinking how cool
      it would be to make some of the incredible mosaics they have displayed.
      This year, I signed up. It’s a 22 hour workshop, spread into 2 hour chunks.
      I’ve been going Monday and Wednesday mornings, and it’s been great. I’ve
      learned how to cut ceramic tiles and also “gres” (their word for sandstone,
      and refers to a matte tile) and how to fit them together. I’ve got a bunch
      of ideas for more projects.
      </p>
 
      <p>So, the other day we make our annual pilgrimage to the Sagrada Familia,
      and my favorite part is always watching what they’re working on, and there
      in the middle of the work area is a small pile of green and gold mosaic
      triangles, just like the ones I’ve been cutting...
