		This is my homepage I am creating for a <i>web authoring and publishing</i> course at <b>Hesston College.</b> <br>
		I am a sophomore currently studying <i>Computer Science</i> at the aforementioned school. <br>
		I run <i>Cross Country</i> as well as <i>Track and Field</i>. In Track my favorite event is the <i>800m.</i> <br>
		I find it interesting because, atleast for the more competive runners, which I am not fast enough for, it is <br>
		the shortest "tactical" race. You'll notice that generally competive runners don't really think about their times. <br>
		because the race is to unpredictable for times to be something to focus on. Unlike the 400m and below where runners <br>
		are forced to stay inside their lanes, the other runners behavior impacts you directly making the race too unpredictable to be treated as a "time trial" <br>
		for example in the 2008 olympic trials, 2 out of 3 of the qualifyiers for the olympics were in <br>
		<a href="https://youtu.be/OeIY_M7YJxk?t=24">it is timestamped to the beginning of the race, which is about 1 minute and 30 seconds long</a> <br>
		last place for the entire race, as they played the entire race in a "sit and kick" tactic where they built their entire race plan around passing <br>
		everyone at the last 100m of the race. If you wish to see a long explanation of Nick Symmonds, a 2 time olympian, thought process in the race <a href="https://youtu.be/i2xouEfXyzo">here it is</a> <br> <br>
		
		My family and I are from <i>California</i>. In an area near <i>Los Angeles</i>. We have lived their my entire life. <br>
		We went to a small church called <i>Pasadena Mennonite Church</i>. I have an older brother, he is about 3 years older than me. <br>
		We have a dog named Koda. <br> <br>
