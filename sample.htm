		The following text will be indented from both sides
		and is useful when quoting text. The text will change
		as the browser window is resized larger or smaller
		but the blockquote indent will always showw. It is also
		possible to "nest" blockquote indent which means
		putting more than one of them in at a time. Be 
		sure to close both of them or interesting things
		will happen
